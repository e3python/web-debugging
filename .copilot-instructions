# Web Debugging - Copilot Support Guide for Students

This file provides vocabulary, definitions, and guidance to help you understand and debug HTML and CSS code.

---

## Essential Vocabulary

### HTML Structure

- **HTML tag:** A label that tells the browser what content is inside it
  - Example: `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`
- **Opening tag:** The start of an element with the tag name: `<tagname>`
- **Closing tag:** The end of an element: `</tagname>`
- **Element:** A complete opening tag, content, and closing tag
  - Example: `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`
- **Attribute:** Extra information about an element
  - Example: In `<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My photo">`, `src` and `alt` are attributes
- **Self-closing tag:** A tag that doesn't need a closing tag because it has no content
  - Example: `<img>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`
- **Nesting:** When one element is inside another
  - Example: `<div><p>Text</p></div>` - the `<p>` is nested inside the `<div>`
- **Indentation:** Spaces at the beginning of a line to show structure
  - Good practice: indent nested elements to show hierarchy

### CSS Properties

- **Selector:** The part of CSS that chooses which HTML elements to style
  - Example: `p { }` styles all `<p>` tags
- **Property:** What you're changing (like color, size, spacing)
  - Examples: `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`
- **Value:** What you're changing the property to
  - Example: In `color: red;`, `red` is the value
- **Rule:** A complete selector and its properties
  - Example: `p { color: red; font-size: 16px; }`
- **Semicolon:** Ends a CSS property (`;`)
  - Must be included after each property value
- **Flexbox:** A way to arrange items in a row or column with spacing
  - Properties: `display: flex;`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`
- **Stylesheet link:** The code in HTML that connects to a CSS file
  - Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

### Accessibility

- **alt text (alternative text):** A description of an image for people who can't see it
  - Goes in the `alt` attribute: `<img alt="A cat sitting on a desk">`
  - Should be descriptive, not just "image"
- **Semantic HTML:** Using the right HTML tags for their meaning
  - Example: Use `<h1>` for main headings, not just any large text

## Common HTML Errors

### "Missing Closing Tag"

- You opened an element with `<tagname>` but forgot `</tagname>`
- Check that every opening tag has a matching closing tag
- Self-closing tags like `<img>` and `<br>` don't need closing tags

### "Incorrect Nesting"

- You closed a tag in the wrong order
- Correct: `<div><p>Text</p></div>`
- Wrong: `<div><p>Text</div></p>` (closed `div` before closing `p`)
- Always close the most recently opened tag first

### "Missing Attributes"

- An element is missing information it needs
- Example: `<img>` needs `src` to know what picture to show
- Example: `<a>` needs `href` to know where to link

### "Broken File Path"

- The filename or path to an image doesn't match the actual file
- Check for: spelling mistakes, wrong file extension, wrong folder
- Example: Wrote `photo.jpg` but file is actually `photo.JPG`

---

## Common CSS Errors

### "Stylesheet Not Linked"

- The CSS file exists, but HTML doesn't know about it
- Check that `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` is in the `<head>`
- Make sure the filename matches exactly (including capitalization)

### "Missing Semicolon"

- You forgot `;` after a property value
- This breaks the CSS rule for that element
- Example: `color: red` should be `color: red;`

### "Typo in Property Name"

- You misspelled a CSS property
- The browser doesn't recognize it and ignores it
- Check spelling: `background-color` not `backgroundColor`, `font-size` not `fontsize`

### "Selector Not Matching"

- Your CSS selector doesn't match the HTML elements you want to style
- Check class names: `.classname` in CSS must match `class="classname"` in HTML
- Check IDs: `#idname` in CSS must match `id="idname"` in HTML

## Debugging Steps

When code isn't working:

1. **Look at the page in the browser**
   - What do you see? What should you see?
   - Is an image missing? Is text the wrong color? Is the layout wrong?

2. **Open Developer Tools** (press F12 or right-click → Inspect)
   - Check the HTML to see if tags are missing or wrong
   - Check the CSS to see if properties are applied

3. **Check for common mistakes**
   - Are all tags opened and closed?
   - Are tags nested correctly?
   - Is the CSS file linked in the `<head>`?
   - Does every CSS property end with `;`?
   - Do class/ID names match between HTML and CSS?

4. **Trace the problem**
   - Sentence frame: "I expected **[what should happen]**, but instead **[what actually happened]**."
   - Example: "I expected the image to show, but instead the page shows a broken image icon."

5. **Make one change at a time**
   - Fix one thing, save, and check the browser
   - That way you know what fixed the problem

## Sentence Frames for Debugging

### When Reading Error Messages or Warnings

- "The browser is telling me that **[problem]** on line **[number]**."
- "This means I need to check **[what to check]**."

### When Analyzing HTML

- "I opened a **[tagname]** tag but didn't close it with `</[tagname]>`."
- "The **[tagname]** element needs an **[attribute]** attribute to work."
- "I nested these tags incorrectly because I closed **[tagname]** before closing **[tagname]**."
- "The image path says **[path]**, but the file is actually **[actual path]**."

### When Analyzing CSS

- "The CSS file isn't connected because the HTML is missing the `<link>` tag in the `<head>`."
- "I wrote the property as **[what was written]**, but it should be **[correct spelling]**."
- "The selector **[selector]** doesn't match any HTML elements because **[reason]**."
- "The CSS is missing a semicolon after **[property]**: **[value]**."

### When Comparing Expected vs. Actual

- "The expected output shows **[description]**, but my page shows **[description]**."
- "I expected the **[element]** to be **[styled]**, but it's actually **[how it appears]**."

### When Describing Fixes

- "To fix this, I need to **[action]** because **[reason]**."
- "I'll change **[what]** to **[new version]** so that **[expected result]**."

## Questions to Ask Yourself When Debugging

1. **About HTML:**
   - Are all tags opened and closed?
   - Are all tags nested correctly (closed in reverse order)?
   - Do image paths match the actual filenames?
   - Are all required attributes present (like `src` for images, `href` for links)?
   - Is the HTML indented to show structure?

2. **About CSS:**
   - Is the stylesheet linked in the `<head>` of the HTML?
   - Do all properties end with semicolons?
   - Are class/ID selectors named correctly?
   - Do the selectors in CSS match the elements in HTML?
   - Are property names spelled correctly?

3. **About Accessibility:**
   - Do all images have meaningful `alt` text?
   - Is the `alt` text descriptive, not just "image"?

4. **About Layout:**
   - Does the page look like the expected output?
   - Is spacing (margin, padding) correct?
   - Are colors, fonts, and sizes applied correctly?
   - Is the flexbox layout working as intended?

## How to Use AI Tools for Help

**Good use of AI tools:**
- Ask what a property does: "What does `justify-content` do in flexbox?"
- Ask for explanations: "Why would a missing closing tag break the page?"
- Ask for guidance: "I think my image path is wrong. How do I check if the file exists?"
- Ask for clarification: "What's the difference between `margin` and `padding`?"
- **Ask Copilot to break down complex problems:** "Look at Lesson 7 in the README. What are the main steps I need to complete, in order?" or "What subtasks should I tackle first?"

**Avoid these requests (they prevent learning):**
- ❌ "Fix my code"
- ❌ "Here's my HTML/CSS, make it work"
- ❌ "What's wrong with this lesson?"
- ❌ "Generate the correct code for me"
- ❌ "Complete this lesson"

**Instead, ask specific questions:**
- ✅ "I see an error about a missing closing tag. Where do I look in my code?"
- ✅ "What should an image tag look like?"
- ✅ "What does 'out of bounds' mean?"
- ✅ "Can you explain what this error message means?"

**Remember:** The goal is for YOU to understand and debug. If Copilot fixes everything, you haven't learned anything. Document any help you get in your reflection!
