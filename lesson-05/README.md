# Lesson 5

## Goal
Fix the text styling so the page looks polished and readable.

## Before You Start
1. Open `lesson-05/index.html` in your browser (or use the Live Server preview in VS Code)
2. Look at the **Expected appearance** image below
3. Compare what you see to the image—what text styling is wrong or missing?
4. Open the Developer Tools (F12) and inspect the HTML
5. Check if the stylesheet is connected in the `<head>`
6. Then start debugging!

## Expected appearance
