# How to Submit Your Work

Follow these steps to commit and push your changes to GitHub using VS Code's Source Control panel.

## Step 1: Save All Your Work

Before submitting, make sure all your changes are saved.

Go to **File** → **Save All** or press **Cmd+Shift+S**

## Step 2: Open Source Control

In VS Code, click the **Source Control** icon on the left sidebar (it looks like a branch) or press **Cmd+Shift+G**.

You'll see a panel showing your changes.

## Step 3: Review Your Changes

Under "Changes" you should see the files you've edited (your lesson folders and REFLECTION.md).

Click on any file to see what you changed.

## Step 4: Stage Your Changes

Hover over "Changes" and click the **+** icon (or click the **+** next to each file individually).

All your changes should move to "Staged Changes."

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes

At the top of the Source Control panel, there's a text box that says "Message (Cmd+Enter to commit)".

Type a commit message describing what you did. For example:
```
Complete lessons 1, 2, and 4 - Feb 24
```

Then press **Cmd+Enter** or click the checkmark button.

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

After committing, you'll see a button that says **"Sync"** at the top of the Source Control panel.

Click it to send your changes to GitHub.

## Step 7: Verify

Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser and refresh the page. You should see your changes reflected in the repository.
