**Need ideas for good questions?** Check out [Example Copilot Prompts](COPILOT_PROMPTS.md) for questions like "What are CSS text properties?" and "How do I make images accessible?"

## Submitting Your Work

When you're finished, [commit and push your changes to GitHub](SUBMISSION.md). Make sure to include a brief reflection on what you learned.

**Important:** Submit your work today to earn a two-week extension if you want to continue working on these lessons.

**Use the [Reflection Template](REFLECTION.md) to guide your thinking about what you accomplished and learned today.**
