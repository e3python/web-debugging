# Lesson 7

## Goal
Create a three-page website for a band with a navigation menu and your own custom styles.

## Before You Start
1. Read the Requirements below carefully
2. Think about the structure: What files do you need to create?
3. What will be on each page (Home, Shows, Music)?
4. How will the navigation menu work?
5. Then start building!

## Requirements
1. Create three HTML pages: **index.html** (Home), **shows.html** (Shows), and **music.html** (Music)
2. Add a navigation menu on each page that links to all three pages
3. Use the content structure from content.txt (you can use The Midnight Owls or choose your own band)
4. Create a stylesheet and apply your own formatting
5. Make sure all pages link to each other properly

## Content
See content.txt for sample content. You can use The Midnight Owls or create content for a band of your choice.

## Tips
- Start by creating the three HTML files with basic structure
- Add the navigation menu to each page (use a list of links)
- Copy the appropriate content into each page
- Create a style.css file and link it from all pages
- Style the navigation menu, headings, and text however you like
