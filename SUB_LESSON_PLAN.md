# Sub Lesson Plan: Web Debugging Activities

**Class Period:** 40 minutes  
**What students are doing:** Debugging (fixing) broken web pages—finding mistakes in HTML and CSS code and correcting them.

---

## Your Role Today

You are **not** expected to know how to code. Your job is to:
1. Make sure students know what to do
2. Keep them on task
3. Monitor that work is being submitted

The instructions are built into the project—students will do most of the thinking.

---

## Before Class Starts

1. **Have the GitHub Classroom link posted on Google Classroom**
2. That's it! Everything else is in the README they'll see when they open the project

---

## Timeline: What Happens When

### **0-5 minutes: Setup & Instructions**

**What to say:**
- "Today you're working on web debugging. You'll fix broken web pages and earn points based on how many you complete."
- "Open the GitHub Classroom link in Google Classroom. It will create your own copy of the project."
- "Clone it to your computer and open it in VS Code. A README will pop up automatically."
- "If you get stuck on cloning, ask a classmate—they'll know how to help."
- "Read the top section of the README. It explains everything you need to know."

**What students will see:**
- A README file opens automatically with clear instructions
- Grading chart (3 pts = approaches, 5 pts = meets, 8+ = exceeds)
- A timeline (they have 5 min to read, 25 min to work, 10 min to submit)

**What you do:** 
- Make sure students know what to do
- Direct cloning questions to classmates
- Answer other questions about the assignment itself

---

### **5-30 minutes: Work Time**

**What students are doing:**
- Picking lessons (they can choose any combination)
- Opening each lesson's README
- Comparing the broken code to the expected output
- Finding and fixing mistakes
- Asking classmates or AI (Copilot in VS Code) for help if needed

**Peer Help Guidelines:**
Students *can* help each other, but they must be doing their own work. Here's what that looks like:

✅ **Good collaboration:**
- "I can't figure out what's wrong. Can you look at my code?"
- Classmate explains what they see: "Your image tag is missing the `src` attribute"
- Student fixes it themselves and understands why

❌ **Not okay:**
- Student copies another student's code
- Student watches classmate type the entire solution
- Students working together on one screen without each doing their own

**Your job:**
- Circulate and monitor
- Make sure they're actually working, not just on YouTube/Discord
- Watch for: ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot Chat open in browser tabs (those indicate they might be getting full solutions)
- **Copilot Chat in VS Code is fine**—that's designed for learning guidance
- If they ask you a tech question you don't know, direct them to:
  - "Check the hints in the lesson README"
  - "Ask a classmate what they see"
  - "Ask Copilot Chat in VS Code (use a specific question, not 'fix my code')"

**Common things they might ask you:**
- "I broke something, can you fix it?" → "Try reverting your changes, or ask Copilot what the error means"
- "Is this right?" → "Compare it to the expected output in the lesson"
- "How do I...?" → "Check the 'Before You Start' section in the lesson"
- "Can we work together?" → "Yes, but you each need to do your own coding and understanding"

**Do NOT:**
- Try to debug their code (you won't know what's wrong)
- Give them answers directly
- Let them copy from classmates without understanding

---

### **30-40 minutes: Reflection & Submission**

**What to say:**
- "Stop coding. You have 10 minutes left. Start your reflection and submit."
- "Open REFLECTION.md from the file list. Answer the questions honestly."
- "Follow the SUBMISSION.md instructions to commit and push your work."

**What they're doing:**
- Filling out a reflection form (asking what they accomplished, what they learned, what help they got)
- Committing their work to GitHub using the terminal

**Your job:**
- Remind them of the time
- Help with any GitHub/terminal issues (but you can use the SUBMISSION.md file as a guide)
- Make sure everyone pushes before leaving class

**If they don't finish:** That's okay. They can continue at home, but push what they have in class.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't clone the repo"
→ Make sure they're logged into GitHub and clicked the Classroom link correctly. If still stuck, have them ask a classmate for help.

### "The lesson says the page should look different but mine looks the same"
→ They probably didn't save their changes, or they're looking at the wrong file. Have them check the "Before You Start" section.

### "I finished all 7 lessons in 15 minutes"
→ Have them do a reflection early and help classmates. Or ask them: "Did you test that everything actually works?"

### "I can't commit/push"
→ Direct them to follow SUBMISSION.md step-by-step. If terminal errors happen, have them try again or ask a classmate.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **You don't need to know coding.** The activity is self-guided.
2. **Students learn by debugging, not by being told the answer.** Let them struggle a little.
3. **The timeline keeps them on track.** If time's running out, remind them to submit.
4. **Most students will succeed** if they try. The point system is forgiving (5 pts for "meets").
5. **Reward helpful students.** If a student is genuinely helping others without doing their work for them, leave a note for the teacher with their name.

---

## Bonus Points for Helpful Scholars

If you notice students being genuinely helpful (explaining concepts, helping troubleshoot, helping with GitHub cloning without just giving answers), **leave a note for the teacher:**

Example:
- "[Student name] helped three classmates get their repos cloned and understood the first lesson. Great peer mentor!"
- "[Student name] explained the difference between margin and padding to a classmate without just fixing their code."

---

## End of Class

Before students leave:
- "Make sure you pushed your code to GitHub"
- "Check that your reflection file is saved"
- "Great job debugging today!"

If a student didn't finish:
- "You can keep working at home, but make sure to push before your next class"
